# hyperspace_waves
author: David Jaros


This repository contains functions for generation and detection of hyperspace waves. It is assumed that these waves, unlike regular waves are able to penetrat any matter, even metal or farraday cage. As they propagate well in frames of reference moving by faster then light velocities, they are supposed to be means of faster then light communication, and they could be possibly exploited as means of back in the time communication.
