# hyperspace_waves
Author: David Jaros

This repository contains functions for generation and detection of hyperspace waves. It is assumed that these waves, unlike regular EM waves, are able to penetrate any matter, even metal or a Farraday cage. As they propagate well in frames of reference moving by faster then light velocities, they are supposed to be possible  means of faster then light communication, and they could be possibly exploited as means of back in the time communication.

Especially balanced versions of hyperspace waves are designed to propagate both in space and hyperspace in exactly same way. Should there be any reflection of signal in hyperspace, or if the signal is just received in a distant point, both situations should lead to reception of signal before it was in dead transmitted.
